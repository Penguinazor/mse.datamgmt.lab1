### *(D)* Understanding the Lucene API

1. The command line demo use stopword removal, indeed : "frame" and "the frame" give the same output  
2. The command line demo don't use stemming, indeed : "information" and "informative" don't give the same output
3. The command line demo is case insensitive, indeed : "test" and "TEST" give the same output  
4. It matter because words like "been", "being" will be transform as "be" and thus considered as stopwords.
